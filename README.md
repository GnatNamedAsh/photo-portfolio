# Photo Portfolio

## Description
Supposed to be a raw vanilla js implementation for a photography portfolio site. Mostly for discovery/skill refinement. No AI use outside of talking through ideas.

Not updated since 2021.

## Goals

Get a functional website for displaying photos, a working UX, etc. without relying on too many packages and mostly done manually.


## Utilities

For this project, I am using Javascript. I'm not going to go too crazy, and things have changed since I started working on this, but to keep it minimal, I'll only be using what is necessary.

Back-end:

- ExpressJS
- request
- request-promise-native

Front-end:

- webpack (for building files easily)

## How to run

1. `npm install` in the directory
2. `npm run build` in the directory
3. `npm start` in the directory
4. Open webpage to `http://localhost:8080/`
